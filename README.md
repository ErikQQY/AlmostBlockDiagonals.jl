# AlmostBlockDiagonals

Partial pivoting LU factorization and linear solver for almost block diagonal matrices. Mainly designed for linear solving in [BoundaryValueDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/BoundaryValueDiffEq.jl). Users who only want to use this package should use with caution.

```julia
a1 = [ 0.1   2.0  -0.1  -0.1
       0.2  -0.2  -0.2   4.0
       -1.0   0.3  -0.3   0.3 ]
a2 = [-0.4  0.4  -5.0
       3.0  0.5  -0.5 ]
a3 = [ 0.6  -0.6  -0.6   5.0
       0.5   4.0   0.5  -0.5
       3.0   0.4  -0.4   0.4 ]
a4 = [ 0.3  -0.3  0.3  7.0 ]
a5 = [ 0.2  -0.2  -0.2   8.0
       6.0   0.1  -0.1  -0.1 ]
A = AlmostBlockDiagonal([a1, a2, a3, a4, a5], [2, 3, 1, 1, 4])
```

Linear solving with pivoting LU factorization:

```julia
B = [1.94,3.04,-0.83,-3.54,2.75,1.32,2.35,1.96,1.52,0.78,2.40]
x = A\B
```
